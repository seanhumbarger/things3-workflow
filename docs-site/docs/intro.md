# Things3 Workflow

## Motivation
As someone who values capturing fleeting thoughts and ideas, I found it challenging to quickly add notes to 
Obsidian while working on other tasks. Obsidian, while powerful, doesn't offer a seamless quick-capture experience. 
In contrast, Things3 provides an excellent quick entry feature—invoked with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Spacebar</kbd>—that 
lets me instantly jot down what's on my mind through a lightweight interface. I wanted a way to bridge these two 
tools: to bring not only my tasks, but also their bodies and any checklist items, directly into Obsidian. When I 
couldn't find a plugin that met these needs, I decided to build my own solution.

## Key Features
- Import tasks, projects, and areas from Things 3
- Configurable filters for tags, projects, and areas
- Customizable note headers and tag handling
- Prevents duplicate imports using a local cache file
- Overwrites notes if the cache is missing but the file exists
- Three command palette commands: Import, Clear Cache, Rebuild Cache
- Desktop-only (macOS; Things 3 is macOS-only)

For installation, configuration, and usage, see the sections below.
