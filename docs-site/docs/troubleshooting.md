# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues
- **Database not found**: Check the path in settings.  On my computer, it's `~/Library/Group Containers/JLMPQHK86H.com.culturedcode.ThingsMac/ThingData-UTCZ/Things Database.thingsdatabase`.  Yours might be similar.
- **No tasks imported**: Adjust your filters or check if tasks are already tagged as imported (see cache).
- **File already exists**: If a note is deleted from the cache but not from the vault, the plugin will overwrite it on next import.
